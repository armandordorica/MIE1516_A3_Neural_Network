    "# (E8) Classification of MNIST Hand-written Digits\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be given an example of [MNIST classification](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). \n",
    "You should be able to replicate the results given here if you have completed (E2)-(E5) correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be best if you have a Python IDE (integrated development environment) such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Anaconda](anaconda.com) is installed because they will make your life easier! If not, you may want to work on the assignment using Google Colab. In any cases, what you need to do is 1) to fill in the blanks in .py files; and 2) to import the files (e.g., layer.py, optim.py, model.py, etc) that you have completed for use. Here are some scenarios how you would go about doing the assignment: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without Google Colab: Python IDE + Anaconda \n",
    "If you have a Python IDE and Anaconda installed, you can do one of the following:\n",
    "- Edit .py files in the IDE. Then, simply open .ipynb file also in the IDE where you can edit and run codes. \n",
    "- Your IDE might not support running .ipynb files. However, since you have installed Anaconda, you can just open this notebook using Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these cases, you can simply import .py files in this .ipynb file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from model import NeuralNetwork\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "#### With Google Colab\n",
    "- Google Colab has an embedded code editor. So, you could simply upload all .py files to Google Colab and edit the files there. Once you upload the files, double click a file that you want to edit. Please **make sure that you download up-to-date files frequently**, otherwise Google Colab might accidentally restart and all your files might be gone.\n",
    "- If you feel like the above way is cumbersome, you could instead use any online Python editors for completing .py files (e.g., see [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3)). Also, it's not impossible that you edit the files using any text editors, but they don't show you essential Python grammar information, so you'll be prone to make mistakes in that case. Once you are done editing, you can either upload the files to Colab or follow the instruction below. \n",
    " \n",
    "- If you have *git clone*d the assignment repository to a directory in your Google Drive (or you have the files stored in the Drive anyway), you can do the following:\n",
    "```jupyterpython\n",
    "from google.colab import drive\n",
    "drive.mount('/content/drive/')          # this will direct you to a link where you can get an authorization key\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.path.append('/content/drive/My Drive/your-directory-where-the-python-files-exist')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, you are good to go. When you change a .py file, make sure it is synced to the drive, then you need to re-run the above lines to get access to the latest version of the file. Note that you should give correct path to *sys.path.append* method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get started!"
